# Collect-and-display-a-dataset-in-augmented-reality-scenario
This project has been developed by Giovanni Ambrosi and Kevin Depedri for the Computer Vision course aa 2021-2022 at the University of Trento.
The app is intended for Android devices only.


# About the project

The project consists in the collection of a dataset in augmented reality. 

After the app started, the device starts scanning the area around for at least 15 seconds. 
Through a tap on the screen the device takes a picture of the environment, places it on a plane and creates an hologram. The hologram is then instatiated in the same position and with the same inclination of the camera of the mobile phone along with an anchor (https://www.andreasjakl.com/raycast-anchor-placing-ar-foundation-holograms-part-3/). The pictures are saved in a predefined path ().
